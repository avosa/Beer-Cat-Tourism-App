# Beer Cat
## React on Rails - Lighthouse Labs Final Project

Do you love Beer? Do you love Cat Puns? Us too.
Our name is funny, but our premise is simple: We're here to help you discover the best local breweries (wherever 'local' happens to be) and help you find your Purrfect Beer Match once you arrive. Whether you love to travel, or simply want to prowl around your own backyard, we have brewery tours and beer recommendations ready for you to pounce on.

Cat puns aside, we're pawsitive you're going to love Beer Cat.

Cheers, 
Your friends at Beer Cat!
